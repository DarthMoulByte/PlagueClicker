# PlagueClicker
All of the code used in my Clicker Tutorial Series!

Hey Guys! This is all of the code that I wrote for my game Plague Clicker that I made for a tutorial series on YouTube.
There are 2 scripts that I haven't included as I did not write them and can't take credit for them.
One is the Kongregate API Script. The other is the Kongregate Preloader HTML file for the WebGL Template.
You can find both of these scripts on the Kongregate Developer Forums.

I have a license included with these files but if you don't want to read it the TL:DR version is essentially you can use this
code for whatever you want in any way you want so long as credit is given and changes made are documented.

If you see any problems with my code or know of ways it can be improved(Which it definitely can be!), please don't hesitate
to let me know! You can email me at nixinteractive@yahoo.com or just search for Nix Interactive on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter!

Good Luck with your own projects!

P.S. If you do use this in a project I would love to see it! Send me a link or something. :D
